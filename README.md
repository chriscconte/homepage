# Personal Website

Hello, you've reached the repo for my personal webiste, [chris.conte.org].

- writings, musings on code or otherwise. 
- personal projects, code or otherwise.
- Resume, CV, about me, linktree.


## Tech

This site is built in js and html. 
Deployment happens via Github actions, and it's all hosted on github pages.

## Content

As of now, this site is just a landing page for my resume.
Though, I like the idea of open-sourcing more of my internet ramblings so that I have the excuse to do more archival, and polishing work.
