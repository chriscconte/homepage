      Designed, developed, and documented web scrapers for collecting hundreds
      of thousands of food objects from the web. Integrated the spiders into a
      suite of other learning algorithms through AWS’s infrastructure. Was able
      to clearly communicate development costs/benefits of various approaches to
      scraping the web to our business needs, and was entirely responsible for
      the design and execution of the codebase.

      I principally designed, developed, and deployed data based features for
      Jubiwee’s web dashboard. I was responsible for the lifecycle of a feature
      which aggregated text-based employee responses into NLP powered
      visualizations for managers to quickly understand employee concerns and
      needs. I also developed and graph based employee proximity tool, which
      enabled employees to interact with their colleagues by playing a game of
      “who-is” while using our software.
